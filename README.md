Simple start to a Java Swing GUI Application using MVC.
Currently using Constants.java as persistant data.
  a) To be replaced by database
Currently stubbed out jdbc driver call
  a) To be integrated and used to make mySQL calls

Things I'd like to add if given the time:
-don't populate all data on load, pagify tables
-change ALL ID primaryKeys to AI
-On number formatted (inventory) qtys, ensure cursor jumps to end
-FIX naming of Inventory/Product -> Make it Supplies/Inventory
